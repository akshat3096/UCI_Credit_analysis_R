# UCI_Credit_analysis_R
Used logistic regression in R for classification of customers that might default on payments and tried to boost accuracy using Cross-Validation, GBM, Random Forests and Neural Networks.
The accuracy levels obtained for different models was as follows:
1. Standard GLM- 80.6%
2. Caret GLM wtih 10 fold CV- 80.6%
3. Gradient boosting- 81.6%	
4. Random forests- 82%
5. Neural Netwroks- 82%
