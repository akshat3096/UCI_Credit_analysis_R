# UCI_Credit_analysis_R
Used logistic regression in R for classification of customers that might default on payments and tried to boost accuracy using Cross-Validation, GBM, Random Forests and Neural Networks.
The accuracy levels obtained for different models was as follows:
Standard GLM- 80.6%
Caret GLM wtih 10 fold CV- 80.6%
Gradient boosting- 81.6%
Random forests- 82%
Neural Netwroks- 82%
